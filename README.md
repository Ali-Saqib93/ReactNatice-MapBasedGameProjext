# ReactNatice-Treasure Hunt
Overview

React Native was used in the development of the location-based smartphone game Treasure Hunt. In quest of hidden treasures, players explore a virtual treasure map superimposed over a real-world map. Players may travel about in real life to find virtual treasures, do missions, and challenge other players by using the geolocation feature on their phone. To provide a captivating user experience, the game incorporates dynamic game mechanics, interactive maps, and real-time multiplayer capability.

Key Features:

Real-Time Geolocation: Using GPS monitoring, players' real-world motions are reflected in the game.

Interactive Map: The virtual treasure sites, checkpoints, and other players are displayed on an overlay of a real-world map by the game.

Treasure Collection: To gather treasure, players must travel to the designated spot on the map.

Challenges & Quests: Players are led to certain areas by randomly generated quests that provide prizes.

In the multiplayer mode, players may engage in treasure hunt competitions and view other users on the map.

Push Notifications: Alerts players to the presence of nearby new challenges or riches.

Progress tracking: Keeps track of game progress, including points earned and valuables found, to ensure consistency between sessions.

Animated user interface: Flowing animations for treasure gathering, marker placement, and status changes.

Tools & Library used:-

.  React Native : foundation for creating the mobile application.

.  react-native-maps : used to show and manipulate the map, which includes player and treasure markers.

.  @react-native-community/geolocation: for GPS monitoring in real-time to mimic player movements.

.  Asyncstorage: to save game state and player progress locally.

.  react-native-reanimated :  React, native, revived: For seamless, game-like animations and transitions in the user interface.

.  react-native-push-notification: to notify players about missions or riches that are close by.

.  react-navigation: For fluid switching between game menus and screen transitions.

Insights and impacts:

1.Enhanced Player Engagement: By using real-world locations and GPS tracking, the game encourages physical movement, which makes it more immersive and engaging for players.

2.Social Interaction: Multiplayer features foster community engagement, letting players compete or cooperate in treasure hunts.

3.Technical Complexity: Real-time updates and geolocation-based interaction required efficient synchronization of data, especially in multiplayer mode.

4.Scalability: The use of Firebase allows the game to handle large numbers of players without compromising performance.

Future Directions:

1.Integration of Augmented Reality (AR):

. Using augmented reality (AR) helps make the game more immersive by enabling users to "see" prizes via the cameras on their phones in real life.
